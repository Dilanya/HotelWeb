# HotelWeb
This is a website that I  created using the MERN stack. MERN stack is a web development framework that is used for easier and faster deployment
of full-stack web applications. It comprises 4 technologies namely: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js1. MongoDB is used as the database,
Express as the web framework, React for building the user interface, and Node.js as the server-side runtime environment2. It is designed to make the
development process smoother and easier.

I have used two separate directories for the Frontend and the Backend. The codes related to both are included separately in the directories.
